abstract: The purpose of this workshop is to demonstrate how to write safe, effective, and intuitive R code for Monte Carlo simulation experiments containing one or more simulation factors. A few of the attractive Monte Carlo simulation coding strategies we will cover are how to write code which is intuitive to read, write, and debug; how to take advantage of SimDesignâ€™s built-in features for creating flexible and extensible simulations; computational efficiency; reproducibility at the macro and micro level; safe and reliable code execution.
