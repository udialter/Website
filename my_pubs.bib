	abstract = {Reporting and interpreting effect sizes (ESs) has been recommended by all major bodies within the field of psychology. In this systematic review, we investigated the reporting of ESs in six social-personality psychology journals from 2018, given that this area has been at the center of psychology’s replication crisis. Our results highlight that although ES reporting is near perfect (even for follow-up tests), interpreting the magnitude of ESs, including confidence intervals for ESs, and interpreting the precision of the confidence intervals needs development. We also highlight widespread confusion regarding the interpretations of the magnitude of ESs within the context of the research.},

Assessing the value of software to statistical learning demands appropriate, valid, and reliable measures. The present study expands the arsenal of tools by reporting on the psychometric properties of the Value of Software to Statistical Learning (VSSL) scale in an undergraduate student sample. We propose a brief measure with strong psychometric support to assess students' perceived value of software in an educational setting. We provide data from a course using SPSS, given its wide use and popularity in the social sciences. However, the VSSL is adaptable to any statistical software, and we provide instructions for customizing it to suit alternative packages. Recommendations for administering, scoring, and interpreting the VSSL are provided to aid statistics instructors and education researchers understand how software influences students' statistical learning.},

	abstract = {Many bodies recommend that a sample planning procedure, such as traditional NHST a priori power analysis, is conducted during the planning stages of a study. Power analysis allows the researcher to estimate how many participants are required in order to detect a minimally meaningful effect size at a specific level of power and Type I error rate. However, there are several drawbacks to the procedure that render it “a mess.” Specifically, the identification of the minimally meaningful effect size is often difficult but unavoidable for conducting the procedure properly, the procedure is not precision oriented, and does not guide the researcher to collect as many participants as feasibly possible. In this study, we explore how these three theoretical issues are reflected in applied psychological research in order to better understand whether these issues are concerns in practice. To investigate how power analysis is currently used, this study reviewed the reporting of 443 power analyses in high impact psychology journals in 2016 and 2017. It was found that researchers rarely use the minimally meaningful effect size as a rationale for the chosen effect in a power analysis. Further, precision-based approaches and collecting the maximum sample size feasible are almost never used in tandem with power analyses. In light of these findings, we offer that researchers should focus on tools beyond traditional power analysis when sample planning, such as collecting the maximum sample size feasible.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The objective of this study was to examine whether a healthy lifestyle composite score of social engagement, physical activity, and Mediterranean diet adherence moderates the association between psychological distress and global cognitive decline among cognitively healthy older adults (67+ years of age at baseline). Methods: A total of 1,272 cognitively intact older adults (Mage = 74.1 ± 4.1 years, 51.9\% female) in the Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Successful Aging (NuAge) completed a series of self-reported questionnaires to measure psychological distress and lifestyle behaviors, and the Modified Mini-Mental Examination (3MS) to assess cognitive performance at baseline and annually over 3 years. Results: Controlling for sociodemographic and health-related characteristics, greater psychological distress was associated with steeper cognitive decline over time among males (B = −0.07, 95\% CI: [−0.12, −0.02]), but not females (B = 0.008, 95\% CI: [0.03, 0.04]). Although a healthy lifestyle composite score did not statistically significantly moderate the distress-cognition relationship (B = −0.005, 95\% CI: [−0.02, 0.01]), there was an association between higher psychological distress and greater cognitive decline at low levels of social engagement (B = −0.05, 95\% CI: [−0.09, −0.006]), but not at high levels of social engagement (B = 0.02, 95\% CI: [−0.03, 0.07]). Conclusion: This study suggests that the potentially harmful impact of stress on cognitive function may be malleable through specific healthy lifestyle behaviors and emphasizes the importance of taking a sex-based approach to cognitive aging research.},

	abstract = {Results of simulation studies evaluating the performance of statistical methods can have a major impact on the way empirical research is implemented. However, so far there is limited evidence of the replicability of simulation studies. Eight highly cited statistical simulation studies were selected, and their replicability was assessed by teams of replicators with formal training in quantitative methodology. The teams used information in the original publications to write simulation code with the aim of replicating the results. The primary outcome was to determine the feasibility of replicability based on reported information in the original publications and supplementary materials. Replicasility varied greatly: some original studies provided detailed information leading to almost perfect replication of results, whereas other studies did not provide enough information to implement any of the reported simulations. Factors facilitating replication included availability of code, detailed reporting or visualization of data-generating procedures and methods, and replicator expertise. Replicability of statistical simulation studies was mainly impeded by lack of information and sustainability of information sources. We encourage researchers publishing simulation studies to transparently report all relevant implementation details either in the research paper itself or in easily accessible supplementary material and to make their simulation code publicly available using permanent links.},

	abstract = {Although chronic stress is a risk factor for poor age-related cognitive health, there is limited research that has examined how cumulative stress across the lifespan affects cognitive aging. There may also be resilience factors that minimize the effects of cumulative stress on cognitive health. Engaging in a healthy lifestyle is protective against cognitive decline and may therefore interact with cumulative stress to buffer the stress–cognition relationship. The objective of the current study was to examine the moderating role of a healthy lifestyle, comprised of physical activity, social engagement, and sleep quality, in the relationship between cumulative stress exposure (CSE) and baseline and change in cognitive performance (global cognition, episodic memory, executive function) over 9 years among 1,297 older adults in the Midlife in the United States cohort (Mage = 69.0 ± 6.4, 57.8\% female).CSE and healthy lifestyle behaviors were indexed using self-reported questionnaires at baseline, and cognitive function was assessed using a battery of standardized neuropsychological tests at baseline and follow-up.Controlling for age, sex, education, race, marital status, employment status, hypertension, diabetes, and depression, higher CSE was associated with poorer baseline performance and slower decline over time in global cognition and executive function, but not episodic memory. A healthy lifestyle did not significantly moderate the relationship between cumulative stress and cognitive function. Exploratory analyses showed a significant cumulative stress–cognition relationship among females only.This study lends support for a lifespan model of cognitive aging and suggests that the cognitive health consequences of stress extend beyond immediate timescales.},

Using motivational interviewing to manage process markers of ambivalence and resistance in cognitive behavioral therapy. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 42(2), 193–203). However, little is known about which therapist characteristics contribute to successful management of resistance. Research has suggested that psychotherapy performance does not improve with experience (Goldberg, S. B., Rousmaniere, T., Miller, S. D., Whipple, J., Nielsen, S. L., Hoyt, W. T., \& Wampold, B. E. (2016). Do psychotherapists improve with time and experience? A longitudinal analysis of outcomes in a clinical setting.

Therapist performance under pressure: Negotiating emotion, difference, and rupture. American Psychological Association). This study aimed to 1) identify whether psychotherapy experience (i.e., training versus no training and number of years of psychotherapy experience) was associated with resistance management skill, and 2) identify whether humility and difficulties regulating emotions among trained individuals were each associated with resistance management. Method: A sample of 76 trained and 98 untrained participants were recruited for the present study. All participants completed the Comprehensive Intellectual Humility Scale (CIHS, Krumrei-Mancuso, E. J., \& Rouse, S. V. (2016). The development and validation of the comprehensive intellectual humility scale.

Psychotherapy, 58, 175–185 ) which was used to assess resistance management skill. Results: Trained individuals performed significantly better on resistance management than untrained individuals; however, years of experience within the trained sample were not associated with resistance management. Conversely, lower humility and greater difficulties regulating emotions were each associated with significantly poorer resistance management in trained individuals. Conclusion: These findings suggest the possibility of improving training to focus on key skills, like resistance management, through supporting humility and emotion regulation in training, as opposed to simply acquiring more experience.},
