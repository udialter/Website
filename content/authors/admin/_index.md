I'm a PhD student at York Universityâ€™s [Quantitative Methods program](https://qm.info.yorku.ca/) in the Psychology Department. I am interested in equivalence testing, accuracy in parameter estimation, effect sizes, and Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, I'm very passionate about teaching statistics, data science, programming, and philosophy of science. I strongly advocate for open-science practices, replicable and reproducible research, and I am an avid R user.
