I am a PhD student in the [Quantitative Methods program](https://qm.info.yorku.ca/) at York University's Psychology Department. My research interests include equivalence testing, Bayesian statistics, multilevel modeling, item response theory, and multiplicity control. I also explore the attitudes and practices surrounding open science, software, and statistics. I'm passionate about teaching statistics and a big R fan. As an advocate for open science, I strive to promote research that's replicable and reproducible.
